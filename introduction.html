              <h2>On Programming</h2>
              <p class="paragraph">
                Besides explaining JavaScript, I will introduce the basic
                principles of programming. Programming, it turns out, is hard.
                The fundamental rules are simple and clear, but programs built
                on top of these rules tend to become complex enough to introduce
                their own rules and complexity. You’re building your own maze,
                in a way, and you might just get lost in it.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                There will be times when reading this book feels terribly
                frustrating. If you are new to programming, there will be a lot
                of new material to digest. Much of this material will then be
                combined in ways that require you to make additional
                connections.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                It is up to you to make the necessary effort. When you are
                struggling to follow the book, do not jump to any conclusions
                about your own capabilities. You are fine—you just need to keep
                at it. Take a break, reread some material, and make sure you
                read and understand the example programs and exercises. Learning
                is hard work, but everything you learn is yours and will make
                subsequent learning easier.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                A program is many things. It is a piece of text typed by a
                programmer, it is the directing force that makes the computer do
                what it does, it is data in the computer’s memory, yet it
                controls the actions performed on this same memory. Analogies
                that try to compare programs to objects we are familiar with
                tend to fall short. A superficially fitting one is that of a
                machine—lots of separate parts tend to be involved, and to make
                the whole thing tick, we have to consider the ways in which
                these parts interconnect and contribute to the operation of the
                whole.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                A computer is a physical machine that acts as a host for these
                immaterial machines. Computers themselves can do only stupidly
                straightforward things. The reason they are so useful is that
                they do these things at an incredibly high speed. A program can
                ingeniously combine an enormous number of these simple actions
                to do very complicated things.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                A program is a building of thought. It is costless to build, it
                is weightless, and it grows easily under our typing hands.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                But without care, a program’s size and complexity will grow out
                of control, confusing even the person who created it. Keeping
                programs under control is the main problem of programming. When
                a program works, it is beautiful. The art of programming is the
                skill of controlling complexity. The great program is
                subdued—made simple in its complexity.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                Some programmers believe that this complexity is best managed by
                using only a small set of well-understood techniques in their
                programs. They have composed strict rules (“best practices”)
                prescribing the form programs should have and carefully stay
                within their safe little zone.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                This is not only boring, it is ineffective. New problems often
                require new solutions. The field of programming is young and
                still developing rapidly, and it is varied enough to have room
                for wildly different approaches. There are many terrible
                mistakes to make in program design, and you should go ahead and
                make them so that you understand them. A sense of what a good
                program looks like is developed in practice, not learned from a
                list of rules.
              </p>
              <h2>What Is JavaScript?</h2>
              <p class="paragraph">
                JavaScript was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to
                web pages in the Netscape Navigator browser. The language has
                since been adopted by all other major graphical web browsers. It
                has made modern web applications possible—applications with
                which you can interact directly without doing a page reload for
                every action. JavaScript is also used in more traditional
                websites to provide various forms of interactivity and
                cleverness.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                It is important to note that JavaScript has almost nothing to do
                with the programming language named Java. The similar name was
                inspired by marketing considerations rather than good judgment.
                When JavaScript was being introduced, the Java language was
                being heavily marketed and was gaining popularity. Someone
                thought it was a good idea to try to ride along on this success.
                Now we are stuck with the name.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                After its adoption outside of Netscape, a standard document was
                written to describe the way the JavaScript language should work
                so that the various pieces of software that claimed to support
                JavaScript were actually talking about the same language. This
                is called the ECMAScript standard, after the Ecma International
                organization that did the standardization. In practice, the
                terms ECMAScript and JavaScript can be used interchangeably—they
                are two names for the same language.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                There are those who will say terrible things about JavaScript.
                Many of these things are true. When I was required to write
                something in JavaScript for the first time, I quickly came to
                despise it. It would accept almost anything I typed but
                interpret it in a way that was completely different from what I
                meant. This had a lot to do with the fact that I did not have a
                clue what I was doing, of course, but there is a real issue
                here: JavaScript is ridiculously liberal in what it allows. The
                idea behind this design was that it would make programming in
                JavaScript easier for beginners. In actuality, it mostly makes
                finding problems in your programs harder because the system will
                not point them out to you.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                This flexibility also has its advantages, though. It leaves
                space for a lot of techniques that are impossible in more rigid
                languages, and as you will see (for example in Chapter 10), it
                can be used to overcome some of JavaScript’s shortcomings. After
                learning the language properly and working with it for a while,
                I have learned to actually like JavaScript.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                There have been several versions of JavaScript. ECMAScript
                version 3 was the widely supported version in the time of
                JavaScript’s ascent to dominance, roughly between 2000 and 2010.
                During this time, work was underway on an ambitious version 4,
                which planned a number of radical improvements and extensions to
                the language. Changing a living, widely used language in such a
                radical way turned out to be politically difficult, and work on
                the version 4 was abandoned in 2008, leading to a much less
                ambitious version 5, which made only some uncontroversial
                improvements, coming out in 2009. Then in 2015 version 6 came
                out, a major update that included some of the ideas planned for
                version 4. Since then we’ve had new, small updates every year.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                The fact that the language is evolving means that browsers have
                to constantly keep up, and if you’re using an older browser, it
                may not support every feature. The language designers are
                careful to not make any changes that could break existing
                programs, so new browsers can still run old programs. In this
                book, I’m using the 2017 version of JavaScript.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                Web browsers are not the only platforms on which JavaScript is
                used. Some databases, such as MongoDB and CouchDB, use
                JavaScript as their scripting and query language. Several
                platforms for desktop and server programming, most notably the
                Node.js project (the subject of Chapter 20), provide an
                environment for programming JavaScript outside of the browser.
